<h2>Project Trajectory</h2>
<p>I am interested in looking for any correlations with 311 reports for NYC social distancing violations with deaths, hospitalizations, and cases per borough in NYC. I am interested in further segmenting the data into trends by age, race, and sex. This is still not set at the moment, and was dependent on the available data online.</p>

<h2>Information about data</h2>
<p>My code is part of this repo: <a href="https://github.com/setu-m/final_project" class="uri">https://github.com/setu-m/final_project</a>. I downloaded the ages data that I graphed on 10-14-2020 from <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data" class="uri">https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data</a>. This data contains deaths, hospitalizations, and cases due to COVID-19 in NYC per age group and borough. I downloaded the 311 violations data from the NYC website on 10-14-2020 from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Social-Distancing-Violation-Reports-Mapped/jdvc-m64z" class="uri">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Social-Distancing-Violation-Reports-Mapped/jdvc-m64z</a>. I downloaded a filtered dataset from this site that just had social distancing violations in the past year.</p>

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>I have additionally wrangled the sex, and race datasets, and have created a joined dataset. I also made a radiobar to allow for the user to check a certain subcategory. I created a dynamic x-axis that would change when the graph changes. I was able to apply a theme to my entire Shiny project. I will investigate putting my RDS files in folders by next week. I also intend to map the 311 data. I went to office hours to get started on this project. I am thinking I will integrate google maps into my map. For the future, I will explore other related datasets to COVID-19 in NYC, such as social distancing policies, or change in legislation, that could also impact deaths, hospitalizations, and cases of COVID-19.</p>
