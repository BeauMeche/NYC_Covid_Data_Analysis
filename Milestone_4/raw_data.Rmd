# Originally, I set extra = drop as I was getting an error. This error was occuring because there were multiple words separated by "_". By dropping the rest of the information past the first "_", I realized that I was losing valuable information. Using extra = merge will display all of the latter information and help me preserve crucial data.

# I worked with Ishan to understand how to split the column that had both the
# county and the type of test into two columns. I first tried to map an
# str_split function but that did not give me the result I wanted. Then, I
# learned about the separate function and tried to map it as well, which created
# an error. Then, I learned that the separate function does not need a map
# function!
