## Project Trajectory
I am interested in looking for any correlations with 311 reports for NYC social distancing violations with deaths, hospitalizations, and cases per borough in NYC. I am interested in further segmenting the data into trends by age, race, and sex. This is still not set at the moment, and was dependent on the available data online.


## Information about data
My code is part of this repo: <https://github.com/setu-m/milestone4.git>.
I downloaded the ages data that I graphed on 10-14-2020 from <https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data>. This data contains deaths, hospitalizations, and cases due to COVID-19 in NYC per age group and borough. I downloaded the 311 violations data from the NYC website on 10-14-2020 from <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Social-Distancing-Violation-Reports-Mapped/jdvc-m64z>. I downloaded a filtered dataset from this site that just had social distancing violations in the past year.  

## Plans
I have wrangled the sex, and race datasets, and have created a joined dataset. I also made a radiobar to allow for the user to check a certain subcategory. However, I am unsure of how to connect my data from the UI to the server, and want to fix that for next week. I also deleted a lot of files, and will put my RDS files in folders by next week. I also intend to map the 311 data. I will also explore other related datasets to COVID-19 in NYC, such as social distancing policies, or change in legislation, that could also impact deaths, hospitalizations, and cases of COVID-19. I also added pretty colors to my graphs, and created a new tab and subtab for my 311 data analysis.
